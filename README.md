# InfinityScroll
These script will make your UnityGUI ScrollRects scroll infinitely. I used the HorizontalLayoutGroup and VerticalLayoutGroup components to display my UI elements.

It's an initial version, not optimized, you should use the same setup as I did in the demo scene.

You should use:
   - ScrollRect
     - HorizontalLayoutGroup / VerticalLayoutGroup
       - Item_1
       - Item_2
       - etc.
